# DirectoryDisco
DirectroyDisco(very) is a python program for discovering hidden directories and soon subdomains. The program is ran on your Linux terminal and can be download as easy as just copying the mainDisco.py file or downloading it. This program is for learning purpose only and is used for CTFs.


## Usage
basic:
`$ python3 DirectoryDisco -u http://1.1.1.1 -w wordlist.txt -x php,txt`

advanced:
`$ python3 DirectoryDisco -u http://1.1.1.1 -w wordlist.txt -x php,txt -t 100` 

## Note:
mainDisco.py for now only is for directories and I'll add subdomains to hunt! for now check that everything is working as it should and maybe add more options/flags/arguments for example http headers or cookies.
